# RTSLabs_CodingExercise
Author: James Overby
Version of Python being used: 3.9.5

Contains the python file which contains the solutions to the first two exercises, and my response to the third question. I also put my answer to the third question within this readme file for accessibility.

Here are the exercises and questions below:

1.) Print the number of integers in an array that are above the given input and the number that are below, e.g. for the array [1, 5, 2, 1, 10] with input 6, print “above: 1, below: 4”.

2.) Rotate the characters in a string by a given input and have the overflow appear at the beginning, e.g. “MyString” rotated by 2 is “ngMyStri”.

3.) If you could change 1 thing about your favorite framework/language/platform (pick one), what would it be?

One thing that I would change regarding my favorite coding language, Python, would be to fix the incompatibility
between the two versions of Python, Python 2.x and 3.x. My issue with this is that both versions are updated regularly
even though Python 3.x is considered the "up-to-date" and "current" version of Python. I think this leads to unnecessary
amounts of confusion when having to switch between the two versions due to some libraries only being supported by specific
versions. Also the way functions are handles in 3.x are handled differently in 2.x. For example, in Python 2.x "print" is handled
as a statement whereas in Python 3.x it treats "print" as a function. Although this is a simple issue and is easy to fix these
inconsistencies between the two versions add up and it can be increasingly frustrating changing between the two versions.
From my previous experience of having to switch between the two versions it does not take much time for me to get used to the
version I am working with, but it may be more productive to keep one current and updated version of Python to prevent this.
